1. The generation of images using AI resonates new information with provided ones.<br>
    a. All images can be generated using previous ones.
        1. This is called "inspiration-using" artistry.
        2. When imitating real-life it's called "still-life" or "fluid-life".
        3. All of life can be drawn in this way if any image of a living thing is drawn at all-- which has happened!
        4. To draw an image using a previous one simply copy single parts of the image to the new one but draw in an effect that isn't already present too.
        5. No part of the image should be a direct copy to make a "master" image, which is a photo-resembling one.

    b. Creating a new image from nothing is possible but isn't what this course is for, except here.
        1. All images must be appealing even if they are of a nasty subject.
        2. When creating an image it must not be disproportionate to the subject focus-- scale of the canvas must fit!
        3. All images are now sponsored by their content, and this will extend to the color palette, focal shift and any other features in design.
        4. To build an image you'll place the main subject focus in the center of the canvas, then fill in the rest with other details-- real or imagined-only.
        5. When a subject is too complicated to describe with only a single image then multiple is a great option.

    c. Building a software to generate new images and why this is useful to do.

2. Using only historical information will oppose, and then terminate all AI images.
    e. When an image is present it must be checked for accuracy.
        1. To oppose the creation of an image you must know what you're looking for.
        2. All images are single-pixel wide but form an even better image when taken together, and this is what you're checking for.
        3. Keeping all images side by side is not the only way they'll fit and so different axes are important to work towards also.
        4. The monitoring of the image is by keeping all images from deviating from a historical standard-- which eliminates any fanciful, moderated-generation of image-- AI resonance, especially!
        5.

    f. All images must not be checked for consistency or there won't be any at all, so finding which to check is important.

    g. Using all parts of an image will become important or the image isn't real, and how to tell and what to do if not.
