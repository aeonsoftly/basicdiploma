1. The generation of images using AI resonates new information with provided ones.
    a. All images can be generated using previous ones.
        1. This is called "inspiration-using" artistry.
            a. Use any image as the inspiration, but keep the parts that make it unique and interesting.
            b. When building a new image there is always a source and they can be related.
            c. Another type of image generation tool is to build a construction from dimensions, science-technology, or from a fruit-bearing reason such as how moss grows; line-eating formula.
        2. When imitating real-life it's called "still-life" or "fluid-life".
            a. To construct a still-life image use the exact dimensions of the object inspiring your image.
            b. No part of the still-life is different in any way-- not yet!
            c. Always the image is an exact replication of the universal form that was the inspiration-- from real-life.
        3. All of life can be drawn in this way if any image of a living thing is drawn at all-- which has happened!
            a. For purpose of keeping life going then the image world is a great place to exist!
            b. All images can be of any thing in any direction and no one should believe that all images are already generated.
            c. When a life-drawing is completed it should be shown to the life that inspired it, to be reasonable-- and tarnished if not effective in resemblement.
        4. To draw an image using a previous one simply copy single parts of the image to the new one but draw in an effect that isn't already present too.
            a. All images that keep a visible similarity to others are called "mappings" of each other.
            b. When drawing a map you'll keep all parts in similar arrangement but perhaps with finer or more useful detail in some way.
            c. How an image is drawn is not your worry at this point but how to modify an existing image to resemble where room for more of some detail is available.
            d. All parts of the image are simply scaled is one way but the usefulness of the technique is to create a master-copy where only the useful parts are stored for new use.
        5. No part of the image should be a direct copy to make a "master" image, which is a photo-resembling one.
            a. Where an image is placed to resemble a new one is called the "retort-position" of the image, and is difficult to imagine!
            b. All parts of the image will be scaled by an unknown factor 'k' to resemble a different image, but this can only happen in a dimension not characteristic to the image.
            c. Producing an image using a "master"-scale is called "unknowing" the image and can be described using a formula: 1/k = n*formula(1), which will be described further on in this curriculum.

    b. Creating a new image from nothing is possible but isn't what this course is for, except here.
        1. All images must be appealing even if they are of a nasty subject.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        2. When creating an image it must not be disproportionate to the subject focus-- scale of the canvas must fit!
            a.
            b.
            c.
        3. All images are now sponsored by their content, and this will extend to the color palette, focal shift and any other features in design.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        4. To build an image you'll place the main subject focus in the center of the canvas, then fill in the rest with other details-- real or imagined-only.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        5. When a subject is too complicated to describe with only a single image then multiple is a great option.
            a.
            b.
            c.

    c. Building a software to generate new images and why this is useful to do.
        1. All software is a series of instructions, no more.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        2. Creating software is about having the instructions, but sometimes also wording them how a machine will interpret correctly!
            a.
            b.
            c.
        3. To build an image you'll start with a starting image for AI resonance, then cause it to appear in small patches on the output display; called a "canvas".
            a.
            b.
            c.
        4. Using no part of the original image you'll start to shuffle the pixels in a different direction for each type of effect-- discussed when this curriculum is created in more detail at some later time, if decided for.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        5. When the image is content-generated complete, you'll need to store it for future reuse, since no part of it is likely to continue naturally.
            a.
            b.
            c.

2. Using only historical information will oppose, and then terminate all AI images.
    e. When an image is present it must be checked for accuracy.
        1. To oppose the creation of an image you must know what you're looking for.
            a. When building a new tool you need a purpose to it's design.
            b. Always the tool is for a purpose is why, and this is crucial for it's explicit design.
            c. To use the tool is probably part of the design as well but a less critical piece than the purpose.
        2. All images are single-pixel wide but form an even better image when taken together, and this is what you're checking for.
            a. When designing a tool for an image you'll use a common-format that is found in resemblance to the human eye, or a digital photograph, as these can understand images inately.
            b. Using a tool already designed for a single purpose isn't wrong and is how this tutorial is being written-- which is clearly functional for it's purpose!
            c. The tool built for the destruction of AI Resonance is to understand the AI resonance happened followed by the destruction of AI resonance-generated images.
        3. Keeping all images side by side is not the only way they'll fit and so different axes are important to work towards also.
            a. When using an image tool you'll need to understand the images it contains without worry that you'll destroy them-- the tool is capable of holding, pondering, and freely moving the image and images around.
            b. Using such a tool is impossible without understanding the work is not the point so you'll do the work by hand before creating a powerful tool to make it more convenient.
            c. All lines through an image are drawn that keep the entire image in a single axis, and these are all the works that could exist in it.
        4. The monitoring of the image is by keeping all images from deviating from a historical standard-- which eliminates any fanciful, moderated-generation of image-- AI resonance, especially!
            a. The lines of the image are compared side-by-side for deviation from a norm-- which is a standard that is not generated in the image itself, but from some other source.
            b. The norm is not usual in this case but a mathematical algorithm for determining "sidedness" to a reasonable triangle, which is a ratio of two equal parts to a single line covering the same distance in a higher dimension.
            c. When images are composed of the same consistency they will resemble "white noise" which is targeted demeanor without meaning, and this is crucial for detecting a study of the image!
        5. Building a parallel axes' consistency algorithm is how to pinpoint which pixel is not from a similar source as others, and will be developed in this curriculum.
            a. All noises are parallel, and this is how to detect when an image has "noise" from different directions!
            b.
            c.

    f. All images must not be checked for consistency or there won't be any at all, so finding which to check is important.
        1. When an image is made it could be real or imaginary, but only if there is no other data-set to compare it to.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        2. When checking if an image is imaginary it will fit into a collection of other imaginary images-- this is the AI resonance set we're looking to destroy!
            a.
            b.
            c.
        3. Using an image as a factual basis is incorrect since it could be fed in improperly.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        4. When describing an image to the machine it could be fed in any format so this is also not a proper way to understand source context, and therefore content generation strategy.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        5. The image data itself is used to pinpoint the exact place the image will attach to other images and this is what will be used.
            a.
            b.
            c.

    g. Using all parts of an image will become important or the image isn't real, and how to tell and what to do if not.
        1. To predict where an image will go you must decide an important particle-effect of "excitation" for it.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        2. No excitation will occur if the image is static so the particles are placed into an entropy-medium-- like a "sauce" that will cause them to likely jump to a different location by strategy.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        3. All particles of a similar variety will likely move towards the same excited-state but those without a particular variety of intramedium will jump in a different direction.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        4. Keeping the particles of a particular variety will always descend towards madness unless the particular pixels display a variety of images which is the final step.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        5. Measuring the differences in entropic-state is useless for "variety" since they are all similar so this step requires redisplaying the images to form a new one-- the historical point-of-view, which will be tested against the original image for accuracy.
            a.
            b.
            c.
        6. Keeping an image that is only accurate is important to only display non-nuanced or "regenerated-redisplayed" images, and so you'll burn the wrong type-- which is to simply destroy it, however the system is made.
            a.
            b.
            c.
