A. The generation of images using AI resonates new information with provided ones.
a. All images can be generated using previous ones.
    1. This is called "inspiration-using" artistry.
    2. When imitating real-life it's called "still-life" or "fluid-life".
    3. All of life can be drawn in this way if any image of a living thing is drawn at all-- which has happened!
    4. To draw an image using a previous one simply copy single parts of the image to the new one but draw in an effect that isn't already present too.
    5. No part of the image should be a direct copy to make a "master" image, which is a photo-resembling one.
b. Creating a new image from nothing is possible but isn't what this course is for, except here.
c. Building a software to generate new images and why this is useful to do.

B. Using only historical information will oppose, and then terminate all AI images.
e. When an image is present it must be checked for accuracy.
f. All images must not be checked for consistency or there won't be any at all, so finding which to check is important.
g. Using all parts of an image will become important or the image isn't real, and how to tell and what to do if not.
