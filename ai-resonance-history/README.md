# AI Resonance and History
AI Resonance is the study of creating images and other resources using a resonating particle. The destruction of AI Resonance-generated images first detects the lack of trajectory aligning with history then destroying such an image in a usual way.

See Lesson.txt for the up-to-date information.

## AI Resonance
To create a resonating particle you must have a source of information, then how it will be modified-- which is fluid. All parts are constructed of the same material, and no "chance" or randomness is necessarily involved. Reproducability is possible in most cases.

### Generating an Image using AI Resonance
All patterns are found in existing images for this purpose. A special formula will generate a scaling-factor that turns an existing, single image into a new pattern with gaps between important sectors.

## History-Depiction Only
All images that are generated by AI Resonance will bear little resemblance to fully-real, accurate images, and should be destroyed for a historical-only depiction through images, or other resources.

### Destroying Non-Historical Images
The pattern of similar sourcing for such images will indicate likely original source material and arbitrary one. The original image is tested against the source-detected for determining likelihood of an unadulterated image, and those found without such a bear likeness should be destroyed.
