1. The generation of images using AI resonates new information with provided ones.<br>
a. All images can be generated using previous ones.<br>
    1. This is called "inspiration-using" artistry.<br>
    2. When imitating real-life it's called "still-life" or "fluid-life".<br>
    3. All of life can be drawn in this way if any image of a living thing is drawn at all-- which has happened!<br>
    4. To draw an image using a previous one simply copy single parts of the image to the new one but draw in an effect that isn't already present too.<br>
    5. No part of the image should be a direct copy to make a "master" image, which is a photo-resembling one.<br>

b. Creating a new image from nothing is possible but isn't what this course is for, except here.<br>

2. Using only historical information will oppose, and then terminate all AI images.<br>
e. When an image is present it must be checked for accuracy.<br>
f. All images must not be checked for consistency or there won't be any at all, so finding which to check is important.<br>
g. Using all parts of an image will become important or the image isn't real, and how to tell and what to do if not.<br>
