# A New Subject

This subject was created using the following logic:
    
    Graph all real solutions to sqrt(tan(x) - y) for x:[0, PI/2] and y:[0,infinity].
    
The domain x:[-PI/2, 0] is implied through the logical use of tan(x) and this terminating function similar to sqrt(1-x), known scientifically also as Darkness and Death. By advancing both I'm able to relate Good and Evil to Be The Same Always, which is what I want. I can generate learning on any subject while not descending too deep into any and also ensure the destruction of All is studied and included carefully.
