To learn about the subject:
1. All privacy is discerned as a conductor under an electric guard which potentiates private, personal data for a customer.
    a. All private data can be kept under wraps by isolating who does have it to who should.
        1. When the process of keeping information is electric then the device will only observe the person it needs one time.
        2. 
        3.
        4. The device will only measure for institutional voltages, which are kept track of by measuring for oscillations in a carrier wave-- which is predictive of existence but not location or other features.
        5. All variables need to be followed with a more definitive measure such as keeping track of gps-location and then if any duplicates have been made-- which is a more advanced convenience only.
    b. No one needs to follow the data-- the police will be called to handle it!
        1. The police will be needed to identify what to do about the information, and they may not always be immediately successful!
        2. All police officers will not necessarily understand how to track information that is carried far and fastly away!
        3.
        4.
        5.
    c. All about mind-mentalfulness is to keep the information loosely out of others' hands, and this should be enough-- which is what this system is!
        1.
        2.
        3.
        4.
        5.

To undo the subject:
2. Systems designed to erase the private information of others in fact also unlock it in other ways.
    e. The process of alerting someone about your private information unlocks it for their eyes as well.
        1. All people will not be protected by one device-- only one at a time, so many such devices will be sending electricity all over the globe-- perhaps further!
        2. When a person is identified to be carrying a device they may be scrutinized for excess possibility-- which is not necessarily important but could lead to adverse, unfair action!
        3.
        4.
        5.
    f. When a person is unscrupulous they will get to see the data and it cannot be erased from their minds except slowly!
        1. A "privacy-safe" digital camera will erase the foreground of a private situation.
        2. This same camera can therefore be used to erase the foreground already protecting a private situation too, if used uncarefully or maliciously!
        3. The image is reviewed digitally to see if anyone need to be erased for reason of privacy-central.
        4. Upon review the image is reshot, even in post-position to determine the information needed to replace them.
        5. A sine-wave is sent through the pixels to be replaced to determine the inteference needed to do work on the subject and the detected source (likely occluded) is signaled for the further information.
        6. Interestingly this is how to obtain a picture of all things so the undermining of privacy is complete while correctly also avoiding undoing it.
    g. No information at all is not how to keep private information away from others and so this process is becoming harder all the time anyway!
